Express Handlebars


What is Express-Handlebars
Its a view engine for express. It adds a lot of features that were removed like the concept of "layout",  "partials", support a directory of partials, etc.


What does Express-Handlebars accomplish in PetDiary
We use handlebars layout to structure the code as its no longer a given feature in the current express.js framework, mainly used due to dockers. Express-Handle bars allows us to modify the HTML file to render information from our express.js, express-handlebars is called everytime we use {{}} in the html document so for example {{username}} will show the username at the location in the html
