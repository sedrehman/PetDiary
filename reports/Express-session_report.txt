What is express-session
express-session allows you to create session middleware in express.


What does express-session accomplish in PetDiary
Expression session allows us to create sessions in PetDiary whereby we store user data in cookie keeping track of hat access they are allowed on the website. This is done by creating cookies (https://github.com/expressjs/session/blob/master/session/cookie.js) where it formats what information cookies take. Then (https://github.com/expressjs/session/blob/master/session/session.js) keeps track of the session  how long it has been and the ID, this is done by taking a request with the information supplied, it will then create a session for that user with an unique ID. The session cookie will then be stored on server end to keep track if user is authenticated. So how does express-sesions work, well it works by creating a cookie with the desired headers and a token added to it. The token is hashed as well by express session and made unique my express session. Express session then stores and handles all the tokens handling their expirations dates as well as to which user each token belongs to.

-> Where we use it:
-> We tell express to use session here
app.use(session({
	secret: 'cse312',
	saveUninitialized: true,
	resave: true
}));
var sess;

-> Here is login is succesful we store the user data into a session
if (username && password) {
    sess = request.session;

    connection.query("SELECT * from users WHERE email=? AND password=?",[username, password], function(error, results, fields) {
        console.log(results);
        // console.log(results.length);
        // console.log(results[0].length);
        // console.log(results[0]);
        if(error){
            response.send('Incorrect Username and/or Password!');
        }
        else if (results.length > 0) {

            sess.user_id = results[0]['id'];
            sess.username = results[0]['name'];
            // console.log(results[0]['id']);
            console.log("logged in! ");
            response.redirect('./home.html');

        }
        response.end();
    });

Licensing
express-session is under MIT license, so itâ€™s free to use as long as we reference Bootstrap on the CSS and style links. This changes nothing for us but that now we had to add the integrity field in the Bootstrap links.
